# Flexy UI Components

See [Documentation](https://nureon22.github.io/flexy-components/) for available components

**This project is still in development and not ready for production use**

## What is Flexy UI?

Flexy UI is a collection of **flexible and customizable web components** designed to enhance native HTML elements.
Each component builds on standard HTML functionality while adding useful features and behaviors.

You can use components directly in plain HTML **without writing any JavaScript**.
However, if you add components dynamically after the page has loaded, **JavaScript initialization is required**.

Some components include more complex HTML templates, which must be written manually.
This can be repetitive or inconvenient when reusing components across multiple pages or projects.

To simplify this, **helper libraries** for popular frameworks like **React, Angular, Svelte, and Hugo** will be provided once the core library is complete.
These helpers let you integrate components seamlessly without manually writing templates.

## Why use Flexy UI?

### Customizable

All components come with **design tokens** that allow you to easily customize their **appearance, layout, and animations**, making it simple to match your brand or project style.

### High Performance

Flexy UI components are designed to include only the **essential features**, reducing unnecessary JavaScript execution.
Some components even require **no JavaScript at all**, ensuring smooth, performant user interfaces.
